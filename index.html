        <h1>In-Depth Understanding of Nested Loops in JavaScript</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Nested loops are powerful tools in JavaScript for handling complex structures and operations. They allow us to iterate through multi-dimensional data and perform tasks that require multiple levels of iteration. In this post, we’ll explore nested loops step-by-step with small examples to gradually build your understanding, and finish with a complex example to bring it all together.
        </p>

        <h2>Basic Looping (One Loop)</h2>
        <p>
            Before diving into nested loops, let's quickly review a basic loop. A loop allows you to repeat a block of code multiple times.
        </p>
        <code>
            // Basic For Loop<br>
            for (let i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(i);<br>
            }
        </code>
        <p>
            In this loop, we are iterating from 0 to 2, logging each number to the console. This forms the foundation for understanding how loops work.
        </p>

        <h2>Introduction to Nested Loops</h2>
        <p>
            Nested loops are simply loops within loops. Let's say you want to iterate through combinations of values, such as days and hours. Here's a simple nested loop example:
        </p>
        <code>
            for (let i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++) {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;for (let j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(i = ${i}, j = ${j});<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
            }
        </code>
        <p>
            Here, the outer loop (i) runs twice, and for each iteration of i, the inner loop (j) runs three times. This means the inner loop completes its full cycle for each iteration of the outer loop.
        </p>

        <h2>Real-World Example: Clock Mechanism</h2>
        <p>
            A classic real-world example of nested loops is a clock mechanism. The second hand completes a full rotation every 60 seconds, which causes the minute hand to move once. Similarly, the minute hand completes a full cycle every 60 minutes, prompting the hour hand to move once. This behavior can be modeled using nested loops:
        </p>
        <code>
            for (let hour = 0; hour &lt; 12; hour++) {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;for (let minute = 0; minute &lt; 60; minute++) {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (let second = 0; second &lt; 60; second++) {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(Time: ${hour}:${minute}:${second});<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
            }
        </code>
        <p>
            In this example, the outer loop controls the hours, the middle loop controls the minutes, and the inner loop controls the seconds. Each second passes, updating the minute and hour hands as needed.
        </p>

        <h2>Brainstorm on your Own</h2>
        <p>
            Have you thought of examples in your own life that could be modeled using nested loops? Here are a few ideas:
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>1. Earth’s Rotation and Revolution:</strong> The Earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours, and simultaneously revolves around the Sun once every 365.25 days. Each rotation triggers a full day, while the revolution continues through the year. This can be modeled with a nested loop: the outer loop for the 365 days of revolution, and the inner loop for the 24 hours of rotation.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>2. Sports Tournaments:</strong> Many sports tournaments follow a similar structure: teams compete in multiple rounds, with each round consisting of a number of games. For example, a knockout tournament could have an outer loop for rounds, and an inner loop for the matches that happen within each round.
        </p>

        <h2>Complex Example: Hourly Greetings Using Nested Loops</h2>
        <p>
            To demonstrate nested loops, let's create a program that generates greetings based on the time of day, split into morning, afternoon, and evening:
        </p>

        <div class="code-container">
            <button class="copy-btn" onclick="copyCode()">Copy</button>
            <code id="hourly-greetings-code">
                let greetings = ['Good Morning', 'Good Afternoon', 'Good Evening'];<br>
                for (let i = 0; i < greetings.length; i++) {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;for (let hour = 0; hour < 8; hour++) {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let currentHour = hour + i * 8;<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(`Hour: ${currentHour}, ${greetings[i]}`);<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
                }
            </code>
        </div>

        <div class="output">
            <span><strong>Output</strong></span>
            <span class="morning">Hour: 0, Good Morning</span>
<span class="morning">Hour: 1, Good Morning</span>
<span class="morning">Hour: 2, Good Morning</span>
<span class="morning">Hour: 3, Good Morning</span>
<span class="morning">Hour: 4, Good Morning</span>
<span class="morning">Hour: 5, Good Morning</span>
<span class="morning">Hour: 6, Good Morning</span>
<span class="morning">Hour: 7, Good Morning</span>

<span class="afternoon">Hour: 8, Good Afternoon</span>
<span class="afternoon">Hour: 9, Good Afternoon</span>
<span class="afternoon">Hour: 10, Good Afternoon</span>
<span class="afternoon">Hour: 11, Good Afternoon</span>
<span class="afternoon">Hour: 12, Good Afternoon</span>
<span class="afternoon">Hour: 13, Good Afternoon</span>
<span class="afternoon">Hour: 14, Good Afternoon</span>
<span class="afternoon">Hour: 15, Good Afternoon</span>

<span class="evening">Hour: 16, Good Evening</span>
<span class="evening">Hour: 17, Good Evening</span>
<span class="evening">Hour: 18, Good Evening</span>
<span class="evening">Hour: 19, Good Evening</span>
<span class="evening">Hour: 20, Good Evening</span>
<span class="evening">Hour: 21, Good Evening</span>
<span class="evening">Hour: 22, Good Evening</span>
<span class="evening">Hour: 23, Good Evening</span>

        </div>
